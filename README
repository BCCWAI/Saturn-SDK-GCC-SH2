| SEGA SATURN HITACHI SUPERH SH-2 GCC C COMPILER |

|OVERVIEW|
This is an optimised version of the GCC C compiler for Hitachi SuperH SH-2
microprocessors.

|BUILDING|
In order to successfully build GCC, the following environment variables need
to be defined:
export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/source
export BUILDDIR=$(pwd)/build
export TARGETMACH=sh-elf
export BUILDMACH=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
export INSTALLDIR=$(pwd)/toolchain
export SYSROOTDIR=$INSTALLDIR/sysroot
export ROOTDIR=$(pwd)
export DOWNLOADDIR=$(pwd)/download
export PROGRAM_PREFIX=saturn-sh2-

PROGRAM_PREFIX is the prefix used before the tool's name, such as:
saturn-sh2-gcc, where gcc is the program, with saturn-sh2- being the prefix.
BUILDMACH is the development machine the compiler will run on.

The BUILDMACH is the system architecture the compiler will run on, while the
TARGETMARCH is the architecture the program or library created will run on.

SKIP_DOWNLOAD can be set to any string to skip the call to `download.sh`, for
example if the dependency tarballs have already been downloaded using something
else.
